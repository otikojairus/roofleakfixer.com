  {
    q: "Can I get documentation for warranty or insurance files?",
    a: "Yes. We can provide service notes, diagnostic summaries, and parts or replacement scope details that are useful for warranty and insurance records. If you need specific documentation formatting, let us know before or during the visit.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I am not sure whether I need repair or replacement?",
